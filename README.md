# Simple Shell
This is a simple implementation of a shell program in C, inspired by the Unix shell. The shell allows users to execute commands, similar to how they would in a traditional command-line interface.

# Features
- Command Execution: Users can execute commands by typing them into the shell prompt.
- Built-in Commands: Implements a few built-in commands such as cd (change directory) and exit (exit the shell).
- Path Resolution: Uses the PATH environment variable to locate executable files.
